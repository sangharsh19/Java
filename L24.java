// Abstract methods in Java
/*
-> An abstract method can include methods that contain no implementation with respect to abstract class. 
-> These are called abstract methods
-> They use 'abstract' keyword before function name
-> the abstract method declaration must end with a semicolon rather than a block

-> If a class has any abstract methods whether , declared or inherited , the entire class must be declared abstract (but the reverse is not true)
-> If an abstract method is inherited it must be defined in ChildClass (override) else the ChildClass must be declared abstract

-> Refer to example of method calculateInterest() of SavingAccount class inherited from abstract class Account
