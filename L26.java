-> Interface can have only public members

-> in Interface you don'y have to write publlic keyword

-> abstract class may or may not contain abstract method
-> in interface all methods are abstract by default (and you don't have to write abstract keyword )

-> interface can have only static member variables but methods are non - static (you don't have to write)

-> variables can be made final in abstract class
